# TransLoc2

Say you want to get from a location on West Campus to a location on East Campus. That's gonna require the bus. If you want a precise ETA so you know when to leave, you'll have to use Google Maps. But Google Maps doesn't have precise bus timingsâ€”it uses the "every 5 minutes" schedule that bus drivers never follow. This service combines the ETA of the walking segments plus data direct from the TransLoc app for the bus segment to give a more accurate prediction of when you can expect to reach your destination.

It's very rough and all, I'm thinking of building a web service for it in the future.
